  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>Welcome to an application that keeps track of how much water you drink in a day.
  This app keeps track of water consumed in a day</p>
  <h3>The purpose of the App</h3>
  <p>The app was created to for students to drink water instead of caffeine. Student tend to consume a lot of caffeine which is harmful to the body causing very dangerious side effects. 
  I decide to come up with a solution to for this problem, designing and programmming an application that will help students drink more water and be fun while at it.
  This app consist of 3 pages. links to the screenshots of the app![Screenshot (27)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/93d820c4-ad59-4dc8-9dd5-3e1fd4ac2348)

![Screenshot (31)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/67b6be73-ce94-4ed1-9dc7-97426e9cd79a). The screenshot where to demonstrate how the app fuctions it has a very engageging interface that is welcoming to the students.
The third page show the full details of how the results of drinking a secnificant amount of water will look.

  <p> As a problem solver I created a flowchart with to show the step by step planning of the application, this is a link to word application containing a flowchart [Hydration Haven flowchart.docx](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/16331384/Hydration.Haven.flowchart.docx)</p>
