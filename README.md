  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>Welcome to an application that keeps track of how much water you drink in a day.</p>
  <h3>The purpose of the App</h3>
  <p>The app was created to for students to drink water instead of caffeine. Student tend to consume a lot of caffeine which is harmful to the body causing very dangerious side effects. 
  I decide to come up with a solution to for this problem, designing and programmming an application that will help students drink more water and be fun while at it.
  This app consist of 3 pages. links to the screenshots of the app![Screenshot (27)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/93d820c4-ad59-4dc8-9dd5-3e1fd4ac2348)

The third page show the full details of how the results of drinking a secnificant amount of water will look.

  <h3>Planning</h3>
  <p> As a problem solver I created a flowchart with to show the step by step planning of the application, this is a link to word application containing a flowchart [Hydration Haven flowchart.docx](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/16331384/Hydration.Haven.flowchart.docx)</p>
  <p>Planning for this App was hard trying to create an app that will be used my young people, making sure that it will not bore them to sleep. The flowchart helped while planning giving a good step of the right direction.</p>
<h3>PowerPoint presentation</h3>
  <p>Created a power point presentation to showcase the application.
