  <h3>The purpose of the App</h3>
  <p>The app was created to for students to drink water instead of caffeine. Student tend to consume a lot of caffeine which is harmful to the body causing very dangerious side effects. 
  I decide to come up with a solution to for this problem, designing and programmming an application that will help students drink more water and be fun while at it.
